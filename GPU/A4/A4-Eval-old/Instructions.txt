Steps for running the evaluation script:

1 : Extract the zip file
2 : Rename the folder and code file in the "Submissions" folder to your roll number (in capital letters, eg., CS19M031)
3 : Run evaluate.sh

-> The number of testcases that your code worked successfully on would be displayed.

-> You can check the log file in "Submissions" folder for results for particular testcases.

-> "output.txt" in "Submissions" folder will contain the output of the last run testcase.
